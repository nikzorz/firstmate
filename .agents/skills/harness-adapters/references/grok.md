# grok (VERIFIED 2026-06-29, grok 0.2.73; slash-submit re-verified 2026-07-03 on 0.2.82; reasoning-effort ceiling re-verified 2026-07-13 on 0.2.99; exit paths re-verified 2026-07-19 on grok 0.2.103)

Per-harness reference for the [`harness-adapters` router](../SKILL.md), which owns the cross-harness contract, the verified-harness list, effort precedence, and the launch-profile axes.

Grok Build TUI (`grok`), a Claude-Code-compatible CLI from xAI.
Launch with a positional prompt: `grok --always-approve "$(cat <brief>)"`.
For Grok's supported reasoning-effort values and omission behavior, see the [launch-profile-axes table](../SKILL.md#launch-profile-axes).

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy-pane signature | `Ctrl+c:cancel` (the mid-turn cancel hint in grok's keybind bar, shown iff a turn is running; the spinner line is a braille glyph + `<status>… N.Ns` + `[stop]`, e.g. `⠹ Thinking… 1.1s … [stop]`). Idle keybind bar shows only `Shift+Tab:mode │ Ctrl+.:shortcuts`. The ASCII `Ctrl+c:cancel` is the busy regex (avoids locale fragility of matching braille). |
| Exit command | `/exit` typed into the composer exits the TUI cleanly and prints `Resume this session with: grok --resume <session-id>`; `Ctrl+Q` double-press within 1000ms remains a fallback; `Ctrl+D` is the quit key in VS Code family terminals; `Ctrl+C` is the interrupt, not the exit. |
| Interrupt | single `Ctrl+C` (cancels the current turn; the footer shows `Ctrl+c:cancel` mid-turn). `Esc` only moves focus to the scrollback, it does NOT interrupt. |
| Skill invocation | `/<skill>` (e.g. `/no-mistakes`), same as claude. Opens a slash-autocomplete popup, so a too-fast Enter selects the popup entry instead of sending. For an argument-taking command that first Enter does not submit at all - it expands the selection into an argument-hint placeholder in the composer (e.g. `/compact` -> `/compact compaction instructions`, live-verified), leaving real text still sitting there unsubmitted; a genuine second Enter is required. `fm-send`'s retried Enter lands it on BOTH backends, but only because each backend's own submit-verification correctly recognizes that placeholder-filled text as still-pending - see the incident below. |
| Autonomy | `--always-approve` (footer shows `· always-approve`); auto-approves every tool execution, verified to run fully unattended. `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` is the stronger equivalent. |
| Env marker | `GROK_AGENT=1`, set for child/tool processes. grok does NOT set `CLAUDECODE` despite Claude compatibility, so the marker is unambiguous. |
| Resume | `grok --resume <session-id>` (id printed on exit) or `grok -c` / `--continue` (most recent for the cwd); `--fork-session` branches a new session id. |

**Incident (2026-07-03, herdr backend only, grok 0.2.82):** two grok/herdr crewmates were sent `/no-mistakes` via `fm-send`; both left it fully typed but unsubmitted in the composer for minutes (footer still `Enter:send`), and `fm-send` exited 0 with no error.
Reproduced live: the herdr adapter's submit-verification at the time treated ANY pane-content change after Enter as "submitted", and the popup-close-with-placeholder-fill described above IS a visible content change even though nothing was actually sent.
The tmux backend's structural `fm_tmux_composer_state` read sees placeholder-filled text on any content row as still pending, so its retry loop sends the needed second Enter.
The Herdr adapter (`fm_backend_herdr_composer_state`, `bin/backends/herdr.sh`) classifies the composer's own row structurally instead of diffing raw content; see `docs/herdr-backend.md` "Composer and injection safety" for the current boundary and `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` for regression coverage.

Startup dialog: the "Run Grok Build in a project directory?" project picker appears ONLY when grok is launched from a non-project directory (home, Desktop, Downloads, `/tmp`).
`fm-spawn` launches inside the treehouse worktree (a git repo root), so the picker never appears and grok treats the worktree as a trusted project automatically - no post-launch keystroke is needed.
Pin `[hints] project_picker_disabled = true` in `~/.grok/config.toml` if a non-project launch ever needs to skip it.

**TRUECOLOR placeholder styling: covered (task afk-herdr-false-pending, 2026-07-10).**
A freshly-dismissed, never-typed-into grok composer shows a placeholder ("Type a message...") styled with a dark 24-bit TRUECOLOR foreground, not the SGR-2 dim/faint attribute the ghost stripper originally detected.
The shared ANSI-aware owner `fm_composer_strip_ghost` (`bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`) now drops a dark/muted truecolor foreground (perceived luminance below `FM_COMPOSER_GHOST_LUMA_MAX`, default 128) as well as dim/faint, so the placeholder is stripped and the row reads empty on both ANSI-capable backends (tmux and herdr route through the same owner).
Verified live against grok 0.2.93: real input is the bright `38;2;224;222;244` (luminance ~225, kept), while grok's borders and placeholder/hint text are dark truecolor (`38;2;50;47;70` .. `38;2;110;106;134`, luminance ~51..110, dropped).
This assumes a dark terminal theme, the fleet reality; the SGR-2 signal stays theme-independent.
Regression coverage: `tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh` (`test_strip_ghost_drops_dark_truecolor_ghost`, `test_dark_truecolor_ghost_only_composer_is_not_pending`) and `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` (`test_composer_state_grok_dark_truecolor_placeholder_is_empty`, `test_composer_state_grok_bright_truecolor_real_text_is_pending`).

**Tmux bottom-border cursor quirk (fixed):**
In a pristine placeholder-only composer, tmux's `#{cursor_y}` can point at the box's bottom border instead of its text row.
The shared tmux reader now locates the complete box structurally and classifies every content row, so the cursor may sit on a content row or the bottom border without changing the result.
The same structural read covers multi-row composers without fixed cursor offsets, while Herdr retains its own structural composer-row scan.

Turn-end hook: grok fires a `Stop` hook at every turn boundary, giving firstmate a precise per-turn wake instead of only stale-pane detection.
grok loads PROJECT hooks (`<worktree>/.grok/hooks/`, `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`) only after the folder is granted hook-trust in `~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`, which is not automatic and which firstmate will not establish by editing grok's own managed trust store.
GLOBAL hooks in `~/.grok/hooks/` are always trusted and load on first launch.
So `fm-spawn` installs ONE firstmate-owned global hook, `~/.grok/hooks/fm-turn-end.json`, plus the companion `~/.grok/hooks/fm-turn-end.sh`, guarded as a no-op for every non-firstmate grok session.
Its `Stop` command fires only when the current workspace holds a `.fm-grok-turnend` token pointer that matches the firstmate-owned hook registry under `~/.grok/hooks/fm-turn-end.d/`.
`fm-spawn` writes that per-task pointer (`<worktree>/.fm-grok-turnend`, gitignored via git info/exclude like the other harnesses' worktree hook files) and a matching registry entry naming this task's `state/<id>.turn-ended`.
The hook reads `$GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, which is always set for hooks and equals the worktree.
This keeps the hook outside the worktree, needs no trust grant, and writes only firstmate-owned files.
`fm-teardown` removes the worktree pointer before returning a pooled worktree.
Secondmate spawns skip the pointer (idle panes are healthy, no stale-pane detection for them).

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-08, Grok 0.2.91).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.grok/hooks/fm-primary-turnend-guard.json` invokes `bin/fm-turnend-guard-grok.sh`.
Grok Stop hooks are passive for this purpose: exit 2 does not make the model continue.
The adapter therefore runs the shared predicate and, when it returns 2, forces one same-session follow-up with `grok --resume <sessionId> -p <guard-reason>` while setting `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1` so the nested Stop hook does not recurse.
It does not pass `--permission-mode`, so the passive hook cannot escalate the primary session's tool permissions.
Project-local Grok hooks require folder trust, verified with launch-time `--trust`; if the primary firstmate checkout is not trusted for Grok hooks, this primary guard fails open and `fm-guard.sh` remains the next-command alarm.
Grok's primary watcher protocol is Claude-shaped background-notify around `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`; the passive Stop hook is only a backstop for blind turn ends.
