# --- the wedge threshold reads the crew's own parked-gate state --------------
# Upstream kunchenguid/firstmate#3055: a lane parked at a validation gate that is
# waiting on a HUMAN is correctly quiet, but nothing in the status LINE says so -
# the evidence is the pipeline's gate state, not anything the worker wrote. One
# such lane reached 671 consecutive escalations on a single home. Neither landed
# mitigation covers it: a declared `paused:` does nothing because a live ordinary
# crewmate's absorb class never reads paused, and raising the threshold delays
# genuine wedge detection for every lane equally.
#
# The distinction that makes this safe is between the two gates the crew state
# both reports as `parked`: one owed a HUMAN, and one owed the CREWMATE's own
# answer. Only the first may go quiet - a crewmate that wedges before answering
# its own gate is exactly the failure this ladder exists to catch - so both
# directions are pinned here, and the crewmate direction is written so that a
# consumer which merely searched the verdict for the token would fail it.
# The second half of that evidence - that the human was actually asked and has
# not answered - is pinned in the test below this one.

# row" - that judgment call was left entirely to the supervisor noticing the
# repetition on its own. This is the safety-net fix: past
# FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the

# 2026-07 hibit-agent-focus-nonsteal-r1 incident: a busy pane (herdr "working"
# and/or the harness's rendered busy footer) is unconditional, unbounded proof
# of liveness in every existing classifier, so a genuinely hung foreground tool
# call behind a busy signature ran undetected for 25h. BUSY_TURN_MAX_SECS bounds
# how long a busy pane may run with no completed turn (state/<id>.turn-ended, or
# the task's spawn record before any turn completes); past the bound, panes
# without a declared external wait or verified captain-held transfer take the
# SAME wedge_timer_check already used for a provably-working non-busy stale.
# Escalation reuses the identical stale reason, escalation counter, and
# demand-deep-inspection marker - never an
# automatic interrupt or restart.

# classify. The busy-turn bound used to be the one stale path that ignored that,
# running the wedge timer under afk and handing the daemon a wake already decorated
# as a possible wedge. That decoration outranks the daemon's own pause verdict, so a
# crew that declared the wait itself was wedge-escalated once per
# FM_STALE_ESCALATE_SECS for as long as the wait lasted, with the escalation count
# climbing into demand-deep-inspection on a pane nobody needed to inspect.
# Phase A pins the handoff: the plain window identity, no wedge timer, no escalation
# counter, and no normal-mode pause bookkeeping (the daemon owns that in away mode).
# Phase B re-arms on the same unchanged pane and pins the one-shot: a second wake
# here is what the climbing ladder looked like. Phase C drives the discriminator
# apart on the SAME afk, busy, over-age pane - lifting the declaration restores the
# wedge escalation, so this is the worker's declaration being honored rather than
# away mode silencing the escalator.

# pane hash re-fires on every poll, and the daemon, which relaunches the watcher
# after each handled wake, is woken in a loop for the whole declared wait. This
# fixture's fake tmux renders a fresh footer on EVERY capture-pane and asserts that
# divergence outright on every re-arm (.hash-<key> moves, .count-<key> never
# climbs), so the one-wake assertion across five silent re-arms cannot pass
# vacuously on a pane that happened to sit still. Round 1 also starts from an
# undeclared wedge timer and escalation count, which the handoff must clear the
# way the normal-mode absorber does, so lifting the declaration later starts the
# wedge path from a fresh timer rather than resuming a stale count.
