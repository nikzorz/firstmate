# Runtime backend verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record contains reusable version-scoped evidence for active runtime guarantees.
The backend guides own current setup, safety boundaries, and limitations.
Exact task chronology, branch names, temporary homes, local paths, process ids, thread ids, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## tmux

Foreground-process behavior was verified on 2026-07-07 with tmux 3.6a on macOS.

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s fmtest -n testwin
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin 'sleep 30' Enter
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin C-c
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
```

Observed output:

```text
zsh
sleep
zsh
```

A persistent parent shell waiting for a child remained reported as the parent process, while a shell that directly execed a simple command changed identity with the process itself.
Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Grok were observed under their own process names.
Kimi Code CLI 0.29.1 was observed under `kimi` on 2026-07-25.
Pi remained a generic `node` process and is intentionally inconclusive.

The structural multi-row composer reader, Kimi pointer-delivery path, and OpenCode 1.18.4 busy-queue behavior are pinned by:

```sh
tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh
tests/fm-kimi-harness.test.sh
tests/fm-tmux-submit-busy.test.sh
```

Expected structural matrix: real text on any content row is pending; all-empty complete boxes are empty; unreadable, incomplete, or unsafe boxes are unknown; and non-bordered panes retain cursor-row compatibility.
Expected submit matrix: proven pending plus busy is accepted as queued; proven pending plus idle remains pending; ambiguous pending is never converted by the busy exception; and only a proven empty composer succeeds directly.

## Herdr

The compatibility floor is protocol 14.
The latest active verification uses Herdr 0.8.2 protocol 20 on Linux x86_64, with earlier 0.7.5, 0.7.4, protocol-14, and 0.7.3 evidence retained where they define current behavior or fallbacks.

Core read-only probes:

```sh
herdr --version
herdr status --json | jq -c '{client:.client.protocol,server:.server.protocol}'
herdr api schema --json | jq -c '.schemas.subscription_event["$defs"].SubscriptionEventKind.enum'
```

Observed current shapes:

```text
herdr 0.8.2
{"client":20,"server":20}
["pane.output_matched","pane.agent_status_changed","pane.scroll_changed"]
```

The CLI matrix was checked directly on the earlier 0.7.x line, most recently on Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 16 on macOS aarch64, and it was not re-run as a whole on the verified pair:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit session routing | `herdr <verb> ... --session <name>` | Reached the named session even while another server was running. |
| Literal send | `herdr pane send-text <pane> <text> --session <name>` | Left text unsubmitted until Enter. |
| Keys | `herdr pane send-keys <pane> enter|escape|ctrl+c --session <name>` | Enter and Escape worked; Ctrl-C interrupted foreground work. |
| Capture | `herdr pane read <pane> --source recent --lines N` | Small N could return empty below viewport height; a 200-line request plus local trim was stable. |
| Native state | `herdr agent get <pane>` | Working and done transitions were visible; long foreground tool waits required rendered-busy corroboration. |
| Restart | guarded named-session stop then start | Workspace, tab, pane, and labels persisted; the agent process and registration did not. |
| Close | `herdr pane close <pane> --session <name>` | The exact one-pane task tab closed; closing a final tab could remove the workspace. |

All destructive verification used `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh` with a non-default `fm-lab-` name and a byte-identical default-session tripwire.
No ambient `herdr server stop` command is a supported test operation.

### Adapter smoke on the verified pair

The adapter smoke suite ran on 2026-09-07 against Herdr 0.8.2 protocol 20, including the real-agent state check:

```sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr-smoke.test.sh
FM_HERDR_SMOKE_REAL_CLAUDE=1 tests/fm-backend-herdr-smoke.test.sh
```

Both invocations passed in full on the verified pair: the default run exercises 16 of the suite's 17 checkpoints, and the `FM_HERDR_SMOKE_REAL_CLAUDE=1` run adds the 17th, the real-agent busy/idle check.

Observed guarantees included:

```text
ok - real herdr: version_check accepts the installed binary's protocol
ok - real herdr: BOTH workspace ids/labels AND both tasks' pane ids survive a session stop + fresh server restart (multi-workspace shape)
ok - real herdr: send_literal + send_key Enter submit as two separate steps (verified: send-text does NOT auto-submit)
ok - real herdr: agent_status busy/idle detection tracks a real claude turn, and capture shows its output
```

The `agent_status busy/idle detection` line is the suite's own label rather than a busy observation.
The same run printed `note: never observed agent_status=working for the real claude run (timing-dependent, not fatal)`, so the busy half of that checkpoint was not seen on the run recorded here.

`herdr workspace --help` on the verified pair still lists no `move` subcommand, so the presentation path's narrowly whitelisted raw-socket request remains required.

### Prune and respawn

The real label-collision reproduction is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-prune-safety-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a pre-existing captain-owned workspace with a seed-shaped tab was adopted for routing but its tab was never eligible for prune because the current create call did not return that seed id.

Restart-husk replacement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-respawn-idem-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a restored no-agent tab was replaced create-before-close, while a registered live agent caused refusal.

### Per-home and presentation topology

Per-home behavior is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-workspace-per-home-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: the primary and secondmate used distinct home workspaces, a child launched by the secondmate stayed in that secondmate workspace, list-live remained home-scoped, and exact cleanup did not affect sibling homes.

The complete projection suite ran on 2026-07-21 against Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees included:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: primary and two secondmate homes each own a top-level contiguous child block
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent primary/A/B spawns stay session-locked with zero focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: session lock contention from a secondmate home falls back flat with no journal
ok - real Herdr lab: legacy projection labels and flat secondmate tabs are left unmigrated
ok - real Herdr lab: multi-home exact-pane teardowns restore captain focus without workspace close authority
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.4 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The suite also covers lost or failed move responses, active-tab refusal, restart husks, missing and duplicate tokens, manual renames, concurrent cleanup, and exact focus restoration.

The mandatory projection suite ran again on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed restart-reclaim guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: Hi Bit and Wheelhouse-style same-identity restarts reclaim one nested space with exact focus and idempotence
ok - real Herdr lab: secondmate restart binding and reclaim stay isolated to the exact child home and parent
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent cross-home recoveries replace exact husks under one session lock with no focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: missing, renamed, and duplicate tokens trigger zero destructive or adoptive calls, and live duplicate risk refuses launch
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

On 2026-09-07 the same projection suite was rerun against Herdr 0.8.2 protocol 20, where it exits non-zero.
The required CI lane is unaffected, because `bin/fm-install-herdr.sh` installs an exact Herdr 0.7.4 pin and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` hard-fails the lane if the installed client version is anything else before the real-herdr-gated family runs.
The suite has 22 pass checkpoints, and the run reached 7 of them before aborting on `assert_cleanup_focus_steal_was_restored`, the 8th checkpoint's guarding assertion in `tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh`.
The 7 observed checkpoints are flag-off spawn ordering, create/tab-create/prune/move focus preservation, active seeded-tab prune refusal, bounded lock-contention flat fallback, the concurrent primary contiguous block, forced `workspace.move` failure, and concurrent post-create abort cleanup.
The 14 checkpoints after the abort never executed on this pair, so no restart-reclaim, multi-home, teardown-focus, or token-safety guarantee is claimed for it here.
That assertion requires the exact task-pane close to first demonstrate Herdr's focus steal and then restore it.
The recorded focus audit shows that close leaving the active workspace and tab unchanged on this pair, so the steal the assertion demands no longer occurs and the adapter's restoration step is a verified no-op rather than a failure.
The suite's own default-session tripwire is not evidence on this path, because the abort route discards the lab teardown's output and exit status.
Captain isolation rests instead on a separate operator check run outside the suite: `herdr session list --json` before and after the runs showed the default session present with `default:true` and `running:true`, and no leftover `fm-lab-` sessions.

The restored-shell session-start cleanup ran on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-herdr-session-cleanup-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: one exact home-local, journal-correlated, one-tab and one-pane childless idle shell was closed after restoration while the exact non-target focus and default fleet session remained unchanged, and a repeat run was a no-op.

### Composer and operational input

Real captures verified these active distinctions:

- Claude and Codex use bare `❯` and `›` agent composers.
- Pi uses content between complete separator rows and requires exact native Pi identity.
- Dim or faint suggestion text is ghost content, while normally styled text is pending input.
- Grok dark truecolor placeholders are ghost content, while bright truecolor typed input remains pending.
- A bare shell prompt has no safe agent-composer container and is unknown.
- Claude Code draws its idle, empty composer as `❯` followed by U+00A0, so the invisible Unicode spaces a terminal UI uses as padding count as blank, while a Unicode-padded bare shell prompt is still unknown.

`tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh`, `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`, and the Herdr composer cases pin the exact captured ANSI bytes.
The U+2063 operational and routed-request separators were exercised through a real Pi-on-Herdr path; the byte-exact active regression is:

```sh
FM_SEND_MARKER_HERDR_E2E=1 \
  tests/fm-send-secondmate-marker-herdr-e2e.test.sh
```

### Native blocked event

The protocol-16 event path was first measured on 2026-07-11 with Herdr 0.7.3 and Python 3.13, and was remeasured on 2026-09-07 with Herdr 0.8.2 protocol 20.
The remeasurement supersedes the earlier 0.7.3 timing, which is no longer quoted here:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-eventwait-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed output from the 2026-09-07 remeasurement on Herdr 0.8.2:

```text
ok - real herdr (herdr 0.8.2): events.subscribe capability gate passes (protocol >= 16, events surface present in api schema)
ok - real herdr (herdr 0.8.2): a driven idle->blocked transition returns the blocked record in 0.068s (pane w1:p2)
ok - real herdr: the watcher fast-path enqueues a stale wake naming the task window from the live blocked transition
```

Polling remained active and is covered as the fallback for capability, connect, subscribe, and repeated reader failure.

### Away-mode transport

The Pi/Herdr return and injection path was reverified on Herdr 0.7.3 and Pi 0.80.7:

```sh
FM_AFK_PI_HERDR_E2E=1 HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-afk-pi-herdr-return-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: pending composer input refused injection and raised one alert; idle Pi accepted one marked escalation; the return gate refused ordinary work while a live blocker remained; resolving the blocker allowed the return flow.
The dedicated Herdr daemon workspace topology is covered by `tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh` and preserves the captain tab's pane count.

## Zellij

The current compatibility floor and latest verification are Zellij 0.44.0 with `jq` on macOS aarch64.
All real tests use a uniquely named session and `tests/zellij-test-safety.sh`; they never touch a session named `firstmate` or call all-session deletion.

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headless session | `zellij attach -b <name>` without a TTY | Created a persistent background session and returned. |
| Session list | `zellij list-sessions --short --no-formatting` | Returned one plain name per line without starting a session. |
| Create tab | `zellij action new-tab --cwd <dir> --name <title>` | Returned a numeric tab id and focused the new tab when a client was attached. |
| Pane discovery | `zellij action list-panes --json` | Included terminal pane id, tab id, plugin flag, and top-level `pane_cwd`. |
| Literal send | `zellij action paste --pane-id <id> -- <text>` | Left text unsubmitted. |
| Keys | `send-keys --pane-id <id> Enter`, `Esc`, and one argument `Ctrl c` | All three shared operations worked. |
| Capture | `dump-screen --pane-id <id>` or `--full` | Worked with no attached client; no line-bound flag exists. |
| Close | `close-tab-by-id <id>` | Removed the live task pane and tab together. |
| Failure exit | actions against missing targets | Returned exit 0, requiring structural preflight and output-shape validation. |

`pane_cwd` stayed frozen when a foreground subshell changed directory.
The marker-delimited `pwd` probe returned the live nested cwd and is covered by the real smoke.
The focus mitigation restored the previously active tab after `new-tab`, with the unavoidable narrow race documented in the operator guide.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij-smoke.test.sh
```

The real lifecycle smoke proved spawn, metadata, nested-subshell worktree discovery, send, capture, unlanded-work refusal, approved local landing, exact tab cleanup, and session cleanup without retaining task-specific ids or branch names here.

## Orca

Real readiness was verified against `/usr/local/bin/orca` with `/Applications/Orca.app` bundle version 1.4.116.

```sh
orca status --json
```

Observed fields:

```text
result.runtime.reachable=true
result.runtime.state=ready
```

`orca terminal create --json` returned `result.terminal.handle`.
`orca worktree create` returned `result.worktree.id` and `result.worktree.path`.
Speculative bare ids and nested terminal fields were deliberately rejected.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
tests/fm-backend.test.sh
tests/fm-bootstrap.test.sh
```

The fake-Orca suite covers readiness, registration, create response parsing, metadata routing, popup-safe submit, and path-matched release refusal.

## cmux

The current compatibility floor is cmux 0.64, and the active live evidence uses 0.64.17 build 97 on macOS aarch64.
Real tests use only exact `fm-test-` workspaces guarded by `tests/cmux-test-safety.sh` and never quit or relaunch the captain's app.

```sh
cmux version
cmux ping
```

Observed version:

```text
cmux 0.64.17 (97) [9ed29d81a]
```

Source and live checks established the five control modes:

- `off` starts no listener.
- `cmuxOnly` rejects an external Firstmate process by ancestry.
- `automation` uses an owner-only 0600 socket with no handshake.
- `password` uses the same 0600 socket plus `auth <password>`.
- `allowAll` uses a 0666 socket with no authentication.

The live default rejection was `Access denied - only processes started inside cmux can connect`.
The live password challenge was `Authentication required - send auth <password> first`.
The app configuration writer did not retain a hand-added socket password, which is why the operator guide requires Settings and a local Firstmate password source.

Current active CLI findings:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | `new-workspace --name <title> --cwd <dir> --focus false --id-format uuids` | Created one workspace with one surface without focusing it. |
| Fresh readiness | `list-panes --workspace <id> --json --id-format uuids` | Found a brand-new surface before content existed. |
| Fresh read counterexample | `read-screen` before any write | Returned `internal_error: Failed to read terminal text`. |
| Literal send | `send --workspace <id> --surface <id> -- <text>` | Left text unsubmitted. |
| Keys | `send-key ... enter|escape|ctrl-c` | All shared key operations worked. |
| Nested cwd | `current_directory` plus foreground subshell | Structured cwd froze; the marker-delimited `pwd` probe found the live cwd. |
| Last surface | `close-surface` on the only surface | Refused with `invalid_state: Cannot close the last surface`. |
| Last workspace | `close-workspace` on the only workspace in a window | Printed success but left the workspace present. |

The last-workspace workaround was reverified on 2026-07-10 in Automation mode.
After creating one unfocused unnamed sibling in the same window, `close-workspace` removed the exact task workspace and left only cmux's default sibling.
A selected non-last workspace closed directly, proving that window cardinality rather than selection is the trigger.

Source inspection confirmed each workspace constructor creates a new UUID with no restored-id input.
Recovery therefore remains title-based.
The bundled Claude wrapper was observed stripping `CMUX_*` variables on its failed socket-probe path while retaining the app bundle id, supporting the macOS-only bundle-id and ancestry fallbacks.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux-smoke.test.sh
```

The real smoke proves socket access, fresh readiness, current-path probing, send and keys, bounded capture, title identity, and guarded exact cleanup.

## Codex App host tools

A reusable Desktop host-tool smoke ran on 2026-07-06 against Codex Desktop bundle version 26.623.101652, build 4674, bundle id `com.openai.codex`.
Local paths and task-specific ids are intentionally not retained here.

The host-tool sequence was:

1. list a saved project;
2. create a Desktop-owned worktree thread;
3. recover and read the thread while active and after completion;
4. verify the thread appended a Firstmate status line and wrote its report;
5. send a follow-up to the same thread;
6. read the completed follow-up;
7. archive the exact thread;
8. read the archived transcript with state `notLoaded`.

Observed guarantee: a Desktop-owned thread can write Firstmate lifecycle files when the prompt provides an authorized absolute path, and create, send, read, and archive work at the Desktop host-tool layer.
The missing guarantee remains a supported shell-callable bridge that lets Firstmate perform those operations against the same visible Desktop endpoint.
App-server partial methods and raw socket experiments do not satisfy that bridge contract.
